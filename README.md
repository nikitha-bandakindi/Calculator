# Calculator
The Simple Calculator with Enter Functionality is a web-based calculator project that allows users to perform basic mathematical calculations conveniently. This calculator provides a user-friendly interface where users can input numerical values and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One notable aspect of your project is that the calculator's memory is cleared when the page is refreshed. This means that any previous calculations or results are not persisted upon page reload.
